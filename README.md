# no_my_zsh_custom
Repo for easily maintaining my ZSH config across many systems.


## Changes so far:
1. added my theme, so ~/.zshrc file can point at bhasterix theme:
```
ZSH_THEME="bhasterix"
```

2. Added common-aliases for things that will apply on all systems
3. Added common config to autoload and *.zshrc files from a ~/.zshrc.d directory
    - for aliases that I only want in certain places.
